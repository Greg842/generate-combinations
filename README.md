A set of Java files that counts and generates finite structures: binary vectors, permutations, combinations, bracket sequences, of a given size.

Each file is responsible for a one structure. The size of structure must be given in a `*name_of_structure*.in` file and the result will be written to `*name_of_structure*.out`.
